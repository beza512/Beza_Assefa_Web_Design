            <h1>History of Graphics Design</h1>
            <p>Graphic design is so much a part of modern world that it is hard to imagine 
                living without it. And in some ways, we never have: visual communication is 
                about as old as our opposable thumbs, though itâ€™s been a long journey from 
                stone tools to digital tablets. In short, the history of graphic design is a 
                story that spans the entirety of human existence and it has the power to 
                inspire and inform even modern graphic designer. For one thing, knowing where, 
                why and how this industry came about helps designers understand their place 
                alongside history. In more practical terms, stylistic trends are cyclical, and 
                studying the past can inspire some innovative ideas in the present.</p>

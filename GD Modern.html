            <h1>Modern Day Graphics Design</h1>
            <p>A few decades ago, no-one could have imagined where computers and the web would 
                take us. Now, we can only look back in awe at the impact the digital revolution 
                has had on the way we work, communication, and socialize. Modern graphic design 
                has become more intuitive and immersive than ever, as artists no longer guess at 
                what their markets are looking for. Inspiration and guidance are everywhere, 
                transforming graphic designers into masters of consumer manipulation.</p>

                <h3>MODERN GRAPHIC DESIGN: THE TRENDS WE’RE SEEING RIGHT NOW</h3>
                <br/>
                The nature of human communication and the rapid pace of the digital world means 
                that it’s often difficult to keep track of the ever-changing nature of graphic 
                design. In an era where technology is everywhere, making creativity more 
                accessible, trends in modern graphic design can dissipate as quickly as they 
                emerge. Something that appeared to be cutting-edge in 2017 might be totally 
                outdated in 2018. Similarly, a design that inspires the world today, might be 
                old news tomorrow. For instance, some of the modern graphic design trends we’re 
                seeing today include:

                <ol>
                    <li>Simplicity</li> 
                	<li>Bold and Brave colors </li>
                    <li>Brand distillation</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

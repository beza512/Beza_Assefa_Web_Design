Graphics design was always something I wanted to look into either, as a profession or a hobby. 
So I took this opportunity to further expand my knowledge on it. In my website I tried to look 
at graphics design in three ways. First, I introduced what graphics design is, talked about the 
history of it and what modern day graphics design looks like. It definitely opened my eyes and 
gave me inspiration to learn deeper and maybe in the future, be a pro in graphics design.
